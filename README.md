# OctoPrint-Camera

This plugin connects and manages the Raspberri Pi camera, allowing other plugins or external processes to query for an image without having to connect directly to the camera.

This can prevent connection locks with a camera if multiple services are in need of a picture.

It uses the `picamera` package to manage the connection and configuration of the camera.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:

## Configuration

**TODO:** Describe your plugin's configuration options (if any).
